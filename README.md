# TensorFlow How-To

This is simply a personal library of annotated snippets in Juptyer Notebooks documenting how to "do" certain things in TensorFlow. Simple things, like loading a graph or using batch normalization. Most everything here is adapted from or outright copied from [Aurélien Géron](https://github.com/ageron), whose fantastic book [*Hands-On Machine Learnign with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do) I am currently working through. Géron already has all of the code and examples for the book hosted in [Notebooks in a github repository](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml), but I also make it a point to try recreating exercises on my own to get it to stick. Moreover, Géron organizes his code by chapter, which makes perfect sense, but I find it hard sometimes to revisit old notebooks (which tend to be quite large) and look up something I forgot how to do. Hence, here I have things broken down "by task" into much smaller notebooks.
